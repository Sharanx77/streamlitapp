# streamlitapp
With the help of the pandas, matplotlib , streamlit, and other modules i done a python code which analyses the dataset saved in the csv file and gives me a report with the graphs and monthly expense tracked
I generated the code from the AI 
I used the streamlit app to create the app easily
